# Analyze A/B Test Results
I analysed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Requirements:
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* statsmodels
